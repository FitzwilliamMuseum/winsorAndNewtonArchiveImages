# Winsor and Newton Archive Images

This repository contains resampled images of scans of recipes included within the
Winsor and Newton Archive held at the Hamilton Kerr Institute, Fitzwilliam Museum.

Images were downloaded using an R script from the original site and then reprocessed
with image magick to reduce their file size, whilst retaining quality. Original store
was 20GB, this is around 5GB.

This repo is included as a submodule of the main site, and is pulled in when set up.
